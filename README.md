# Renewable-energy
Renewable energy of Australia from 2005 to 2021. 

**Executive Summary:**

This report assesses the renewable energy transition of Australia from 2005 to 2021, comparing its performance with three regional countries, and predict renewable-generation levels through 2030.

**Project Goals & Scope:**

Four topics would be discussed in this report:
	- The proportion of renewable energy in Australia since 2005: Measure the share of renewables in Australia’s total electricity generation (2005 – 2021).
	- The makeup of renewable sources: Examine the contribution of each renewable source and how it changes over time.
	- Regional comparison: Compare Australia’s renewable share with Indonesia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. 
	- 2030 Forecast: Produce a data-drive prediction of total renewable-generation in 2030.

**Data analysing methods:**
The data sources are Australian Energy update 2024, Australian Energy Statistics 2023, World Development Indicators. The data was extracted, transformed, and loaded Power BI. The data was then visualized to present the findings of the data. Linear model was also used to predict the total renewable-generation in 2030.

**Key findings:**

- An increasing share of renewable sources in Australia was found by 2022, indicating strong post-2020 acceleration.
- Hydro and bagasse’s share of renewables shrank, replaced by other renewable sources such as small-scale solar, large-scale solar, and wind. 
- Australia outperforms Indonesia, but not as good as Papua New Guinea (40%) and New Guinea (85%), leaving room for improvements to catch up with regional countries. 
- Renewable energy is predicted to be around 96 980 GWh in 2030. To align with national targets, growth rates will need to speed up beyond the linear trend.

**Report Findings**
	
  **The proportion of renewable energy in Australia since 2005**

Data significance

As the government is attempting to increase the generation of renewable energy, knowing the proportion of renewable energy the country is generated since 2005 is crucial. Knowing the trend since 2025 gives the insights on how effective the policies have been since 2005 until now. The government can then define the best policy to optimize renewable energy generation. Knowing the trend in the last 10 years helps the government set realistic goal for the next period.

Moreover, analyzing the proportion of energy since 2005 helps demonstrate transparency. A clear, data-driven reporting on historical performance builds public trusts, therefore help building the budget allocation, and meet international reporting requirements. For lenders and project developers, this data reduces investment risk by presenting the growth the renewable energy.

By understanding the past and current situation, the Government would have a better vision of “where we’re going”. The proportion of renewable energy shows how it is penetrating, which plays the role of a diagnostic tool and the guide for future policy.

**Methods of analyzing data**

The data is collected from Australian Energy update 2024, which is from Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, Australia Government. The data defines ‘Renewable energy’ is the sum of Bagasse, Biogas, Geothermal, Hydro, Large-scale Solar, Small-scale Solar, and Wind. The proportion of the energy which is from renewable sources is calculated by the sum of renewable resources divided by total national generation (GWh).

Figure 1: Proportion of renewable energy generated
The graph above illustrates how the proportion of energy which is generated from renewable energy throughout the years. The X-axis represents the year, which is from 2005 to 2022. The Y-axis is the renewable energy proportion, going from 0.00 % to 3.00%. 
As can be seen on the graph, in 2005, the energy generated by renewable resources accounts for 2.41% of the country’s electricity. There was then a small decline, reaching the low of 1.84% in 2008, then steadily hovered around 2.03 – 2.09% from 2009 to 2019. After 2020, the is a sharp increase with the renewables rose to 2.46% in 2021, and 2.67% in 2022.
The answer to the question: In 2022, 2.67% of the energy was from renewable energy – up from 2.41% in 2005. There was a slight decrease in the late 2000s, the renewable proportion was stabilized around 2%, then increased sharply after 2020. 
In conclusion, the substantial jump in 2020 indicates that the recent policy works well. The overall renewable energy is still low. 

**The makeup of renewable sources**

 <img width="399" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26d1bb1d-1161-46f7-a9ec-774183406a71" />

 Figure 2: The makeup of renewable resources

**Data significance**
To generate and use more renewable energy, it is necessary to understand how each renewable source allocated. It helps the government to capture the current trend, for example, measure the change from legacy renewables (hydro, bagasse) to emerging sources (solar, wind). From that, the government evaluates the policy impacts by linking a certain policy to a renewable source and track the growth.

Having a data-driven evidence of the make-up of each resources make it transparent to the stakeholders. Therefore, public trust is built and the public image of the government is maintained. Stakeholders such as investors also gain benefit from the transparent data by being able to track the historical performance insights, and reduce the risk of investing in renewable projects.

**Methods of analyzing data**
The data source is Australian Energy Statistics 2023. The makeup of each renewable source is calculated by dividing the sum of each source by the total amount of renewable source in the year. The renewable is defined as the aggregation of Bagasse, Biogas, Geothermal, Hydro, Large-scale Solar, Small-scale Solar, and Wind. 


**Data Analysis**

100% stacked-bar was used to show relative proportions. The X-axis represents the Years from 2005 to 2022. The Y-axis is the percentage of total renewable generation (0-100%). 
As can be seen on the graph, there are significant changes during the years. Hydro took about 65% of the renewables in 2005, while in 2021, it steadily declined to 45%. The reason might be the emergence of newer renewables. The Bagasse slightly increased from 2005 to 2007, then also declined gradually to 5% in 2021. The growing sources are wind, large-scale solar, and small-scale solar. Wind sources rose from about 5% in 2005 to about 25% in 2021. Large-scale solar scaled from 0 in 2005 to roughly 10% in 2021. Small-scale solar also increased from 0% in 2005 to 15% in 2021. 
**The answer:** From 2005 to 2021, the renewable-energy mix in Australia has changed significantly: Hydro declined from 65% to 45% of renewable generation. Bagasse decreased from 10% to about 2%.  Wind rose from 5% to 25%. Large-scale solar scaled from 0 to roughly 10%. Small-scale solar increased from 0% to 15%. 
In conclusion, the proportion of hydro decreases and replaced by other renewable sources such as small-scale solar, large-scale solar, and wind. 

**Regional comparison: Compare Australia’s renewable share with Indonesia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea**
**Data significance**
Since the neighboring countries might have similar geographic characteristics, comparing Australia with the three neighboring countries might give valuable insights on how Australia’s performance in renewable energy generating compare to those with similar context. Based on this information, Australian government can adjust the goals and aspirations of the country, and also grasp the competitive positioning within the region. 
Furthermore, the data helps identify the successful measure of the better-performing countries, which can be adapted locally. It is an effective way to increase the generation and use of the renewable sources. 

**Methods of analyzing data**
This data is collected from World Development Indicators. The renewables definition is consistent across all four countries, which contains hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, and bioenergy. The metric is expressed as a percentage. The annual renewable generation is calculated by the formula:

Renewable Share (%)=(Total Annual Generation(GWh))/Annual Renewable Generation (GWh)   x 100

Figure 3: Australia and three neighboring countries comparison
The chart above is the multi-line chart comparing the renewable energy sources of Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. The X-axis represents the Years from 2005 to 2020, while the Y-axis is the renewable share among four countries (0-100%). 

As can be seen in the above graph, there is a constant trend among four countries. Australia went up gradually from 1.5% in 2005 to 25% in 2021, yet still fell behind New Zealand’s 85% and PNG’s 40%. Indonesia had a small growth from 15% to 18%. Papua New Guinea’s shares decreased until 2018, then had a rebound in 2019. New Zealand maintains the highest shares, and had consistently grown since 2005. 

**The answer:** Australia has a 25% renewable share in 2021, which is above Indonesia’s 18%, but stills slightly below Papua New Guinea’s 40%, and far below New Zealand’s 85%. Although Australia has grown sharply since 2005, there are still significant room for improvement to match with the regional leaders.

**Recommendation:** Australia should learn the policy from New Zealand if applicable, since New Zealand is currently the regional leader.

**2030 Renewable Energy Volume Forecast**

**Data significance**
Forecasting the generation of renewable energy helps Australia quantifies the goal and the scale of actions required to meet the goal. By delivering a data-drive forecast, Australia can align its 2030 renewable-energy ambition with realistic, evidence-backed projections.
**Methods of analyzing data**
The data is collected from Australian Energy Statistics 2023, with the values from 2005 to 2021 (GWh). Linear regression was used to regress total renewable generation on time (year). The model is used to generate point forecast for Year 2030. 
There are some assumptions made to make this prediction. First, it is assumed that the historical growth trend continues linearly through 2030 without any major structural shocks such as the supply-chain disruptions. Second, the data collection methodology is assumed to be stable. 


Data Analysis

Figure 4: Renewable energy generation forecast
The chart above is the scatter plot of historical renewable-generation (black dots), linear trend line (blue), and 2030 forecast point (red). The X-axis is the Year, and Y-axis is Total Renewable Generation (GWh).

The elements on the graph are: the black dots (observed data (2005 – 2021), solid blue line for fitted linear trend, the red marker at 2030, which is the point forecast at 96 980 GWh, shaded blue band indicating 95% of prediction interval.

Based on the graph, it is estimated that the total renewable generated in 2030 is 96980 GWh. With 95% prediction interval, the estimation is roughly between 85 000 GWh and 110 000 GWh. The historical data suggests a non-linearity since 2015 onwards based on an upstick in the slope. 

**The answer:** Based on a linear-trend projection of historical data, Australia’s renewable-generation volume is forecast to be roughly 96 980 GWh by 2030. 

**Conclusion:**
**The purpose of the project**
For the purpose of increasing renewable energy generation and use, multiple aspects have been analyzed, such as how renewable energy adoption in Australia evolved since 2005, benchmarking Australia against key regional peers, and to forecast the scale of renewables development by 2030. 

**The method of data**
The data was collected from multiple sources such as Australian Energy update 2024, Australian Energy Statistics 2023, World Development Indicators. The data was calculated and visualized with many chart types. For predictions, linear model was used to predict the renewable energy in 2030.

**Important findings**
There are four questions to be further analyzed in this report. First, the share of renewable energy in Australia. The share was calculated by dividing total renewable generation (bagasse, biogas, geothermal, hydro, solar, wind) by the total annual renewable generation. An increasing share of renewable sources was found by 2022, indicating strong post-2020 acceleration.

Second, the makeup of each renewable energy sources were defined. Total renewables were disaggregated into each sources using 100% stacked bar to visualize shifts among hydro, geothermal, bagasse, biogas, solar, and wind. Hydro and bagasse’s share of renewables shrank, replaced by other renewable sources such as small-scale solar, large-scale solar, and wind. 

The third question was to compare Australia’s renewable share with Indonesia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. Australia outperforms Indonesia, but not as good as Papua New Guinea (40%) and New Guinea (85%), leaving room for improvements to catch up with regional countries. 

Lastly, the forth question was to have 2030 outlook. Renewable energy is predicted to be around 96 980 GWh. To align with national targets, growth rates will need to speed up beyond the linear trend. 
Shortcoming & next steps:

This report is built based on a simple linear model, which omits all non-linear relationships. Future work should include more complex models to make predictions.
